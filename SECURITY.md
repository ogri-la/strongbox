# Security Policy

Security issues are taken very seriously, however severity and urgency are difficult to measure.

Strongbox is not a large or complex project so all security issues will be treated as equally severe and urgent.

## Supported Versions

Strongbox *will* support security updates for the current major version.

Strongbox *may* backport security updates for the previous major version.

All other major versions are unsupported.


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 2.x.x   | :heavy_minus_sign: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, open a regular ['bug report' issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) and fill in the sections. 

Ensure the 'steps to reproduce' are filled out in detail. Optionally tag the issue with 'security'.

A security issue may be closed if it cannot be reproduced.
