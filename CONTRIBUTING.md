# Contributing

I'm grateful you are interested in contributing.

## bugs

To get a bug looked at I must be able to recreate it.

1. create an [issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox/issues) to describe the bug

2. run the application with the `--debug` flag. For example, `strongbox --debug` or `java -jar strongbox.jar --debug`.

3. When the application exits, the version of strongbox and the path to the log file will be printed to the console. 
Include the version in the bug report and attach the log to the ticket. The log file will include your hostname and list 
of installed addons so make sure you're OK with that.

## feedback, feature requests

If you are a user of strongbox and you ever want to get in touch, please just [open an issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox/issues).

## code

I prefer to **not** receive *code* contributions.

If you spot a typo or think an error message is no good, I'm happy to consider changes to those.
