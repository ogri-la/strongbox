# Contributing

I'm grateful you are interested in contributing.

## feedback, feature requests

If you ever want to get in touch, please just [open an issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox/issues).

I love *all* feedback including criticism, compliments, feature requests and especially bug reports.

## bugs

To get your bug fixed I must be able to recreate it.

1. create an [issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox/issues) to describe the bug

2. run the application with the `--debug` flag. For example, `strongbox --debug` or `java -jar strongbox.jar --debug`.

3. When the application exits, the version of strongbox and the path to the log file will be printed to the console. 
Attach the log to your bug report. The log file will include your list of installed addons so make sure you're OK with that.

## code

I prefer to **not** receive *code* contributions.

If you spot a typo or think an error message is no good, I'm happy to consider changes to those.
