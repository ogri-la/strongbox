    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.14 - 17th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.  Some minor tweaks to flight point tooltips.\r\n- The 'Faster looting' option ('System') will now work with TSM Destroy.  You no longer need to disable fast looting when using TSM Destroy.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.13 - 16th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.  Some minor tweaks to flight point tooltips.\r\n- The 'Faster looting' option ('System') will now work with TSM Destroy.  You no longer need to disable fast looting when using TSM Destroy.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.12 - 15th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.  Some minor tweaks to flight point tooltips.\r\n- The 'Faster looting' option ('System') will now work with TSM Destroy.  You no longer need to disable fast looting when using TSM Destroy.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.11 - 15th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.  Some minor tweaks to flight point tooltips.\r\n- The 'Faster looting' option ('System') will now work with TSM Destroy.  You no longer need to disable fast looting when using TSM Destroy.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.9 - 15th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.\r\n- The 'Faster looting' option ('System') will now work with TSM Destroy.  You no longer need to disable fast looting when using TSM Destroy.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.8 - 14th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.\r\n- The 'Faster looting' option ('System') will now work with TSM Destroy.  You no longer need to disable fast looting when using TSM Destroy.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.86.alpha.3 - 14th January 2022\r\n- Added more flight times.  Keep reporting until there's none left to report.\r\n\r\n2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.85 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.85.alpha.3 - 13th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.

    "body": "2.5.85.alpha.1 - 10th January 2022\r\n- Added lots of flight times.  Keep reporting.\r\n\r\n2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.

    "body": "2.5.84 - 9th January 2022\r\n- For 'Show flight times' ('Interface'), added support for odd flight points (such as Altar of Sha'tar).\r\n\r\n2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.

    "body": "2.5.83 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Added more flight times.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.  Flight map tooltips will now show the number of flight hops as well as the flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.13 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Added more flight times.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.  Flight map tooltips will now show the number of flight hops as well as the flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.12 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Added more flight times.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.  Flight map tooltips will now show the number of flight hops as well as the flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.11 - 9th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' option now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Added more flight times.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.  Flight map tooltips will now show the number of flight hops as well as the flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.9 - 7th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Hellfire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Alliance: Blood Watch to The Exodar\r\n- Alliance: Nethergarde Keep to Booty Bay\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: Shattrath to Toshley's Station\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: The Altar of Sha'tar to every connected flight point (and vice versa)\r\n- Alliance: The Exodar to Blood Watch\r\n- Many thanks to the people that reported their flight details when prompted.  If everyone reports flight details when prompted to do so by the addon, every flight time will be accurate and you will never see those report windows again.\r\n- Flight map tooltips will now show the number of flight hops as well as the flight time.\r\n- Currently, the flight times are only accurate if you know all the connecting flight points.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.8 - 7th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Hellfire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Alliance: Blood Watch to The Exodar\r\n- Alliance: Nethergarde Keep to Booty Bay\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: Shattrath to Toshley's Station\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: The Altar of Sha'tar to every connected flight point (and vice versa)\r\n- Alliance: The Exodar to Blood Watch\r\n- Many thanks to the people that reported their flight details when prompted.  If everyone reports flight details when prompted to do so by the addon, every flight time will be accurate and you will never see those report windows again.\r\n- Flight map tooltips will now show the number of flight hops as well as the flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.7 - 7th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Hellfire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Alliance: Blood Watch to The Exodar\r\n- Alliance: Nethergarde Keep to Booty Bay\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: Shattrath to Toshley's Station\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: The Altar of Sha'tar to every connected flight point (and vice versa)\r\n- Alliance: The Exodar to Blood Watch\r\n- Many thanks to the people that reported their flight details when prompted.  If everyone reports flight details when prompted to do so by the addon, every flight time will be accurate and you will never see those report windows again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.

If everyone reports flight details when prompted to do so by the addon, every flight time will be accurate and you will never see those report windows again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).

If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.4 - 6th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Hellfire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Horde: The Stormspire to Garadar\r\n- Alliance: Everlook to Astranaar\r\n- Alliance: Nethergarde Keep to Booty Bay\r\n- Alliance: Nethergarde Keep to Southshore\r\n- Alliance: Refuge Pointe to Booty Bay\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: Shattrath to Cosmowrench\r\n- Alliance: Shattrath to Toshley's Station\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: Telredor to Honor Hold\r\n- Many thanks to the people that reported their flight details when prompted.  If everyone reports flight details when prompted to do so by the addon, every flight time will be accurate and you will never see those report windows again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk. V (Mark V is Alive!), Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen (Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off), Drijya (Sabotage the Warp-Gate!), Bessy (When the Cows Come Home), Image of Commander Ameer (Delivering the Message), Captured Protectorate Vanguard (Escape from the Staging Grounds), Earthmender Wilda (Escape from Coilskar Cistern), Skywing (Skywing), Chief Archaeologist Letoll (Digging Through Bones) and Skyguard Prisoner (Escape from Skettis).  Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.3 - 6th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Hellfire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Horde: The Stormspire to Garadar\r\n- Alliance: Refuge Pointe to Booty Bay\r\n- Alliance: Stormwind to Thelsamar\r\n- Alliance: Shattrath to Toshley's Station\r\n- Many thanks to the people that reported their flight details when prompted.  If everyone reports flight details when prompted to do so by the addon, every flight time will be accurate and you will never see those prompt windows again.\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.2 - 6th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Hellfire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Horde: The Stormspire to Garadar\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.

    "body": "2.5.83.alpha.1 - 5th January 2022\r\n- Updated flight times:\r\n- Horde: Area 52 to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Hellfire Peninsula to Shattrath\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to The Stormspire\r\n- Horde: Shattrath to Thrallmar\r\n- Horde: The Stormspire to Garadar\r\n\r\n2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.

    "body": "2.5.82 - 5th January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.

    "body": "2.5.82.alpha.7 - 2nd January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect, you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.

    "body": "2.5.82.alpha.5 - 1st January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added some missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, you will now only see the flight time printed in chat if it does not match the time stored in the addon.  If you see the chat message with flight details, report the flight information shown so that it can be added to Leatrix Plus and you won't see the chat message for that flight again.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A. Million Mk.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.82.alpha.4 - 1st January 2022\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added some missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, you will now only see the flight time printed in chat if it is different to the saved flight time or if the flight does not exist in Leatrix Plus database.  So if you see the chat message with flight details, report the flight information shown so that it can be added to Leatrix Plus and you won't see the chat message for that flight again.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.82.alpha.3 - 31st December 2021\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added some missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, you will now only see the flight times printed in chat if there is a difference of at least 5 seconds between the actual flight time and the saved flight time or if the flight does not exist in Leatrix Plus database.  So if you see the chat message with flight details, report the flight information shown so that it can be added to Leatrix Plus and you won't see the chat message for that flight again.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.  This applies to Ranger Lilatha (Escape from the Catacombs), Anchorite Truuen (Tomb of the Lightbringer), Magwin (A Cry For Help), Fhwoor (Fhwoor Smash!), Kayra Longmane (Escape from Umbrafen), Mag'har Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Horde), Kurenai Captive (The Totem of Kar'dash, Alliance), Isla Starmane (Escape from Firewing Point!), Maxx A.

Many thanks to drejjmit for supplying the list.\r\n- The 'Manage widget' configuration panel will now show a warning if Titan Panel is preventing the widget frame position from saving correctly.. \r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') is now called 'Dismount me'.  It now has a configuration panel so you can set which dismount rules you want to use including a new setting that dismounts you when you instruct a flight master to open the flight map.\r\n\r\n2.5.37 - 26th May 2021\r\n- The 'Dismount automatically' option ('System') will no longer dismount you if you are out of range of your target.\r\n\r\n2.5.33 - 21st May 2021\r\n- The 'Stand and dismount' option is now called 'Dismount automatically'.  Most of what it did before is now included in the game.  So now, the option will dismount you when you select a flight location or when you attempt to cast a spell regardless of whether you have enough resource to cast or whether the target is in range.\r\n- Fixed an issue with 'Recent chat window' which caused a Lua error when attempting to show Battle.net messages.\r\n- The 'Remove raid restrictions' option has been removed since it's not needed for Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n\r\n2.5.32 - 17th May 2021\r\n- Welcome to Burning Crusade Classic.\r\n- Leatrix Plus for Burning Crusade Classic is based on Leatrix Plus for World of Warcraft Classic with the changes listed below.\r\n- Added 'Manage focus' ('Frames'), 'Mute game sounds' ('System') and 'Remove raid restrictions' ('System').\r\n- Added Burning Crusade zones, dungeons, titles, credits, narration tracks and movies to 'Media'.\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now adds pan (right-button), zoom (mousewheel) and toggle attributes (middle-click) functionality to the character frame, dressup frame and inspect frame.\r\n- The 'Class colored frames' option ('Frames') now colors the focus frame too.\r\n- Thanks to Blizzard for the day one beta access allowing me to bring Leatrix addons to the BCC community.\r\n"

    "body": "2.5.82.alpha.2 - 31st December 2021\r\n- The 'Show flight times' setting ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added some missing flight times.\r\n\r\n2.5.81 - 29th December 2021\r\n- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.\r\n- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.\r\n\r\n2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.\r\n\r\n2.5.79 - 18th December 2021\r\n- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.\r\n\r\n2.5.78 - 17th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.75 - 16th December 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).\r\n- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.\r\n- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').\r\n\r\n2.5.74 - 9th December 2021\r\n- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.\r\n\r\n2.5.73 - 8th December 2021\r\n- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).\r\n- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).\r\n\r\n2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.\r\n\r\n2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021\r\n- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.\r\n\r\n2.5.70 - 1st December 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.\r\n- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.\r\n- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.\r\n\r\n2.5.68 - 17th November 2021\r\n- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').\r\n- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.\r\n- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).\r\n- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.\r\n\r\n2.5.67 - 10th November 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.\r\n- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.\r\n\r\n2.5.66 - 4th November 2021\r\n- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.\r\n\r\n2.5.64 - 29th October 2021\r\n- Replaced packager to fix CurseForge App issue.\r\n\r\n2.5.62 - 28th October 2021\r\n- The 'Enhance dressup' option ('Interface') now shows a 'Show target model' button in the dressup window.  Requires a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply whichever model is showing.  Transformations such as shapeshift and appearance change will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  Dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.\r\n- The 'Enhance quest log' option now has a setting to toggle showing quest levels.\r\n- The 'Sell junk automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the vendor summary in chat.\r\n- The 'Repair automatically' option now has a setting to toggle the repair summary in chat.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue with 'Recent chat window' ('Chat') which caused the title bar text to overlap the message count for some locales.\r\n- Fixed a few locale issues with invalid translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.61 - 21st October 2021\r\n- Added 'Chimes' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If enabled, clock hourly chimes will be muted.\r\n- The 'Enhance tooltip' option ('Interface') now scales Total RP 3 tooltips.\r\n\r\n2.5.59 - 13th October 2021\r\n- Added a new option called 'Show druid power bar' ('Interface').  If enabled, a druid power bar will be shown in the player frame while you are playing as a shapeshifted druid.\r\n- The 'Dismount me' option ('System') will now work with Shaman Ghost Wolf.  Added a new setting to show an unshift buton on the flight map when playing as a shapeshifted druid or shaman.  The setting to dismount when selecting a flight destination has been removed as that functionality is now built into the game.\r\n- The 'Release in PvP' option ('Automation') now has a configuration panel that lets you exclude Alterac Valley.  You can also set a delay timer before you are automatically released.  You can hold shift as the timer is ending to cancel automatic release.\r\n\r\n2.5.58 - 29th September 2021\r\n- Quests from Soridormi and Arazmodu (The Scale of the Sands, Caverns of Time) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n\r\n2.5.55 - 16th September 2021\r\n- Updated for World of Warcraft patch 2.5.2.\r\n- Added guild bank support for 'Repair automatically ('Automation').\r\n\r\n2.5.53 - 19th August 2021\r\n- Fixed issue caused by malformed translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.48 - 5th August 2021\r\n- Added 'Gyrocopters' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  This includes the engineering flying machine mounts.\r\n\r\n2.5.47 - 22nd July 2021\r\n- Improved quest automation for Aldor/Scryer repeatable reputation quests in Shattrath.\r\n\r\n2.5.44 - 30th June 2021\r\n- Updated Classic Profession Filter addon compatibility fixes for 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') to support the latest version.  If you use Classic Profession Filter addon, you need to update it.\r\n\r\n2.5.43 - 24th June 2021\r\n- Fixed a situational issue with 'Faster auto loot' ('System') which caused the loot window to sometimes remain open if you are in a group using free for all loot with multiple group members looting the same corpse at the same time.\r\n- Updated the tooltip for 'Invite from whispers' ('Social') to highlight that an invite will not sent in response a Battle.net message if the invite recipient is showing offline.\r\n\r\n2.5.42 - 16th June 2021\r\n- Added a new setting to 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface') which allows you to see guild ranks for players who are not in your guild.  It's disabled by default.\r\n- Fixed a compatibility issue with 'Enhance professions' and 'Classic profession filter' addon.\r\n- Removed the 'Class icon portraits' option ('Frames') due to performance issues.  There are standalone addons available for this feature if you need it.\r\n\r\n2.5.41 - 9th June 2021\r\n- Added a note about framerate to the 'Class icon portraits' ('Frames') tooltip.\r\n\r\n2.5.39 - 6th June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from Archmage Leryda (The Violet Eye) will no longer be selected, accepted or turned-in automatically.\r\n- Updated translations.\r\n\r\n2.5.38 - 2nd June 2021\r\n- For 'Automate quests' ('Automation'), quests from BCC escort quest givers will not be accepted automatically.
